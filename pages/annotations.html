I can ride my bike with no handlebars<br />
No handlebars<br />
No handlebars<br />
I can ride my bike with no handlebars<br />
No handlebars<br />
No handlebars<br />
<br />
Look at me, look at me<br />
Hands in the air like its good to be<br />
Alive and I'm a famous rapper<br />
Even when the paths are all crookedy<br />
I can show you how to dosey doe<br />
I can show you how to scratch a record<br />
I can take apart the remote control<br />
And I can almost put it back together<br />
I can tie a knot in a cherry stem<br />
I can tell you about Leif Ericson<br />
I know all the words to "De Colores"<br />
And "I'm proud to be an American"<br />
Me and my friends saw a platypus<br />
Me and my friends made a comic book<br />
And guess how long it took<br />
I can do anything that I want 'cause look<br />
<br />
I can keep rhythm with no metronome<br />
No metronome<br />
No metronome<br />
I can see your face on the telephone<br />
On the telephone<br />
On the telephone<br />
<br />
Look at me, look at me<br />
Just called to say that its good to be<br />
Alive in such a small world<br />
I'm all curled up with a book to read<br />
I can make money open up a thrift store<br />
I can make a living off a magazine<br />
I can design an engine<br />
64 miles to the gallon on gasoline<br />
I can make new antibiotics<br />
I can make computer survive aquatic<br />
Conditions I know how to run the business<br />
And I can make you wanna buy a product<br />
Movers shakers and producers<br />
Me and my friends understand the future<br />
I see the strings that control the systems<br />
I can do anything with no resistance 'cause<br />
<br />
I can lead a nation with a microphone<br />
With a microphone<br />
With a microphone<br />
And I can split the atoms of a molecule<br />
Of a molecule<br />
Of a molecule<br />
<br />
Look at me, look at me<br />
Driving and I won't stop<br />
And it feels so good to be alive and on top<br />
My reach is global<br />
My tower secure<br />
My cause is noble<br />
My power is pure<br />
I can handout a million vaccinations<br />
Or let em all die from exasperation<br />
Have 'em all healed from their lacerations<br />
Or have em all killed by assassination<br />
I can make anybody go to prison<br />
Just because I don't like them<br />
I can do anything with no permission<br />
I have it all under my command because<br />
<br />
I can guide a missile by satellite<br />
By satellite<br />
By satellite<br />
And I can hit a target through a telescope<br />
Through a telescope<br />
Through a telescope<br />
<br />
And I can end the planet in a holocaust<br />
In a holocaust<br />
In a holocaust<br />
In a holocaust<br />
In a holocaust<br />
In a holocaust<br />
<br />
I can ride my bike with no handlebars<br />
No handlebars<br />
No handlebars<br />
I can ride my bike with no handlebars<br />
No handlebars<br />
No handlebars
