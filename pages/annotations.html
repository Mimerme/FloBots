<span>I can ride my bike with no handlebars</span></span><br />
<span>No handlebars</span><br />
<span>No handlebars</span><br />
<span>I can ride my bike with no handlebars</span><br />
<span>No handlebars</span><br />
<span>No handlebars</span><br />
</span><br />
<span>Look at me, look at me</span><br />
<span>Hands in the air like its good to be</span><br />
<span>Alive and I'm a famous rapper</span><br />
<span>Even when the paths are all crookedy</span><br />
<span>I can show you how to dosey doe</span><br />
<span>I can show you how to scratch a record</span><br />
<span>I can take apart the remote control</span><br />
<span>And I can almost put it back together</span><br />
<span>I can tie a knot in a cherry stem</span><br />
<span>I can tell you about Leif Ericson</span><br />
<span>I know all the words to "De Colores"</span><br />
<span>And "I'm proud to be an American"</span><br />
<span>Me and my friends saw a platypus</span><br />
<span>Me and my friends made a comic book</span><br />
<span>And guess how long it took</span><br />
<span>I can do anything that I want 'cause look</span><br />
</span><br />
<span>I can keep rhythm with no metronome</span><br />
<span>No metronome</span><br />
<span>No metronome</span><br />
<span>I can see your face on the telephone</span><br />
<span>On the telephone</span><br />
<span>On the telephone</span><br />
</span><br />
<span>Look at me, look at me</span><br />
<span>Just called to say that its good to be</span><br />
<span>Alive in such a small world</span><br />
<span>I'm all curled up with a book to read</span><br />
<span>I can make money open up a thrift store</span><br />
<span>I can make a living off a magazine</span><br />
<span>I can design an engine</span><br />
<span>64 miles to the gallon on gasoline</span><br />
<span>I can make new antibiotics</span><br />
<span>I can make computer survive aquatic</span><br />
<span>Conditions I know how to run the business</span><br />
<span>And I can make you wanna buy a product</span><br />
<span>Movers shakers and producers</span><br />
<span>Me and my friends understand the future</span><br />
<span>I see the strings that control the systems</span><br />
<span>I can do anything with no resistance 'cause</span><br />
</span><br />
<span>I can lead a nation with a microphone</span><br />
<span>With a microphone</span><br />
<span>With a microphone</span><br />
<span>And I can split the atoms of a molecule</span><br />
<span>Of a molecule</span><br />
<span>Of a molecule</span><br />
</span><br />
<span>Look at me, look at me</span><br />
<span>Driving and I won't stop</span><br />
<span>And it feels so good to be alive and on top</span><br />
<span>My reach is global</span><br />
<span>My tower secure</span><br />
<span>My cause is noble</span><br />
<span>My power is pure</span><br />
<span>I can handout a million vaccinations</span><br />
<span>Or let em all die from exasperation</span><br />
<span>Have 'em all healed from their lacerations</span><br />
<span>Or have em all killed by assassination</span><br />
<span>I can make anybody go to prison</span><br />
<span>Just because I don't like them</span><br />
<span>I can do anything with no permission</span><br />
<span>I have it all under my command because</span><br />
</span><br />
<span>I can guide a missile by satellite</span><br />
<span>By satellite</span><br />
<span>By satellite</span><br />
And I can hit a target through a telescope</span><br />
Through a telescope</span><br />
Through a telescope</span><br />
</span><br />
<span>And I can end the planet in a holocaust</span><br />
<span>In a holocaust</span><br />
<span>In a holocaust</span><br />
<span>In a holocaust</span><br />
<span>In a holocaust</span><br />
<span>In a holocaust</span><br />
</span><br />
<span>I can ride my bike with no handlebars</span><br />
<span>No handlebars</span><br />
<span>No handlebars</span><br />
<span>I can ride my bike with no handlebars</span><br />
<span>No handlebars</span><br />
<span>No handlebars
